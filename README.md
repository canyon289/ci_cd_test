Creating a CI/CD workflow thatll publish an issue every night automatically


## Steps
1. Create a basic CI script that runs when main branch is updated (Completed)
2. Create an issue ticket template in Github (Completed)
3. Create a basic script that creates an issue ticket when main branch is updated (Completed)
4. Automatically have CI run every minute (just so we can make sure it works)  
  * Eventual goal: Is to have an issue ticket postd at 12 pm PST everyday

## What CI CD will do for us
Every night (for me) at 12 PST a computer will "wake up" and automatically create an issue ticket in my repo
